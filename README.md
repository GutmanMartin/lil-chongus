# LIL' CHONGUS 

This is the code for an arduino powered DIY midi controller. It supports both an arduino MEGA and UNO, althought the latter one will have less capabilities.

Features:

Intended to operate 4 channels.
5 knobs (4 linked to channels, one for BPM)
16 main buttons (12 of them operable by an Arduino UNO)
2 switches (effects/looping, BPM monitor on/off). I intend to add another once I get to buy it.
3 buttons for changing tabs ("pages". Left - right and up/down)
1 extra button for separate functionality (operable by UNO)

It's fully functional, and kinda commented, but not really well documented. Changes may or not ensue.
The case of the thing was 3d printed, so you can always ask for those files, I just didn't upload them because I'm lazy. I just made this to access this code from different computers, really. If it is helpful to someone, it wouldbe a plus.
